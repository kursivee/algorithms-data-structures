## Tidbits
- [Leetcode uses kotlin JS which is why it's so slow](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kotlin/comments/byd93g/why_is_kotlin_so_much_slower_than_java_on_leetcode/)

## Dynamic Programming (AKA BANE OF MY EXISTENCE)
I don't have a really good resource for this. There's good examples and intro out there. But trying to apply it in practice confuses the absolute hell out of me.

## Profiles
Way more active on leetcode since that had a bigger problem set of easys :D also supported kotlin before hackerrank.
